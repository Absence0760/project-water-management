// The CHIRPS cells a catchment boundary covers (issue #326 B-rain, WP-2.10 ×
// WP-3.12; docs/maps.md § Rain from the boundary). Pure and dependency-free:
// the from-boundary routes (feeds/fromBoundary.ts) call it on the project's
// `catchment_boundary` map feature.
//
// Each 0.05° cell the boundary touches gets the weight
//     share of the cell inside the boundary × cos(the cell centre's latitude),
// the same weighting bboxCells gives a box (feeds/config.ts), so the feed's
// rainfall is the area-weighted mean over the boundary itself rather than over
// the box around it. Holes are subtracted; the parts of a MultiPolygon add up.
//
// Method: exact clipping, not sampling (geo/clip.ts). Every ring is clipped to each cell
// square with Sutherland–Hodgman (the cell is convex, so clipping a concave
// ring to it still gives a polygon whose signed area is exactly the area of
// the intersection: the extra edges the algorithm leaves along the cell's
// sides run there and back and cancel), and the share is that area over the
// cell's, in degrees. A ring is first clipped to its row of cells, then each
// row's piece to the row's cells, so the work is about (rows + cells) ×
// vertices. The share is exact to floating point; sampling on a fine grid
// would carry an error of the order of the sample spacing along the boundary
// and cost far more points for the same accuracy. Within a 0.05° cell the
// degree-space share and the true (ellipsoidal) share differ by under 1e-4,
// since the cell's width changes by that little from its bottom to its top.
//
// A cell with less than MIN_SHARE of its area inside is left out: its weight
// would move the mean by less than that share of one cell's rain, and every
// listed cell is read on every day (and must have data: a listed sea cell
// fails the fetch).
