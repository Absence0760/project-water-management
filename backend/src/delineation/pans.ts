// Pans: the part of a delineated catchment that drains into a closed
// depression (docs/design/delineation.md § Pans; the research behind the
// thresholds, docs/design/pans-research.md). Priority-Flood fills every
// depression so that D8 can route it to the outlet (flow.ts); in South
// Africa's interior many of those depressions are pans, endorheic wetlands
// whose runoff evaporates instead of reaching the river, and WR2012 counts
// their catchments as non-contributing ("endoreic areas"). This module reads
// the fill's output (the elevations before and after it) and reports that
// area beside the routed catchment. It never changes the routing: the
// catchment proposed stays the gross one, and the non-contributing figure
// is the hydrologist's to use or not (the PFRA's gross and effective
// drainage areas, both reported).
//
// A closed depression counts as a pan when all three hold:
//  * it is at least PAN_MIN_DEPTH_M deep below its spill;
//  * its floor (the cells the fill raised) covers at least PAN_MIN_FLOOR_M2;
//  * it holds at least PAN_MIN_STORAGE_MM of its own catchment's runoff
//    below its spill, so an average year's runoff can't fill it: a dam on a
//    river drawn down below its spillway, or the pond behind a road
//    embankment, holds a few millimetres over its catchment and is not a pan.
// A depression holding a point (the outlet, or a unit's point), or spilling
// to one within the snap radius, is that point's own (a dam's basin behind
// the clicked wall), never a pan.
//
// The storage test alone can pass a large dam low in a small catchment (an
// off-channel or pumped-storage dam, a river dam drawn down a long way). So
// a depression that passes it is cross-checked against the river network
// and the dams already loaded (PanReference: the river network's reaches,
// the project's rivers and dams, the register of dams): one a mapped river
// flows through and out of at its spill, or with a dam at its spill or on
// its floor, is storage on a river, listed apart and not counted as a pan
// (docs/design/pans-research.md § Storage on a river). HydroRIVERS is traced
// on a filled DEM, so its lines run through most pans as well: only a reach
// HydroSHEDS routes to the sea counts, and only where the ground below the
// spill drops past the depression's floor within ON_RIVER_WALL_M, as below a
// dam's wall (a pan spills over a low saddle). A river that ends in a
// depression leaves it a pan.
//
// Pure apart from the reference's loader: typed arrays in, a mask and figures out.
