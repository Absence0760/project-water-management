// Where a click on the map goes on the DEM's channel network (issue #472,
// docs/design/delineation.md § Method, step 6). The outlet is a point on a terrain
// channel: a cell the DEM's own routing drains ON_CHANNEL_KM2 or more
// through, the red lines the Map draws (channels.ts). The click goes on the
// nearest such cell within the snap radius, and nowhere else; with none
// within it the click is refused, so an outlet never sits on a slope or in
// a gully the Map doesn't draw.
//
// Mapped rivers (HydroRIVERS, the basemap's waterways) never move it. Issue
// #374 had matched the click to the nearby HydroRIVERS reach's upstream area,
// up to a kilometre away, and asked which river at a mapped confluence; but
// the DEM's rivers often run somewhere else than the mapped lines, so the
// outlet went where the mapped river said rather than where the editor
// clicked on the DEM's (issue #472). The editor picks the channel; the app
// only puts the click on it.
//
// One check stays, from the DEM alone: when the channel the click goes on
// has a channel LARGER_FACTOR times its area within GUARD_RADIUS_M, that
// channel is named to offer ("Use that channel"), never moved to by itself:
// a gauge or a dam placed from its coordinates (Start, Divide) on a hillside
// stream beside the river it measures says so, and the editor decides.
