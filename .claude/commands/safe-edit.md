description: Implement a non-trivial change with a code-reviewer agent loop — coder → review → fix → review → ready-to-commit. Costs ~2-3x a normal edit; use when the change warrants the extra rigor.
argument-hint: <task description>

Implement the task `$ARGUMENTS` with a project-specific code-reviewer agent in the loop.

## When to use this command

**Right fit:**
- Security-sensitive changes — anything touching the <payment-processor> ITN handler, the <CMS> webhook handler, CORS config, rate limiting, the email pipeline (especially the banking-details regression test), or the SOPS-encrypted secrets files.
- Order-flow changes — `POST /orders`, `GET /orders/:ref`, the order status state machine, the customer status emails.
- <CMS> schema changes — `studio/schemas/*.ts` plus the matching `backend/src/cms.ts` type + helper + new route.
- Infra changes — anything under `infra/`, especially OIDC trust policy, S3 bucket policy, KMS, CloudFront security headers, Lambda permissions.
- Cross-workspace refactors that touch frontend + backend + studio at once.
- Anything you want a second pair of eyes on before commit.

**Wrong fit — refuse and tell the user to edit directly:**
- Typos and one-line doc corrections.
- Comment edits.
- Single-property CSS / Svelte template changes.
- Dependency-version bumps that don't change source.
- Anything where the diff is going to be < ~10 lines and touches no project invariant.

The cost of this loop is real (~2-3x tokens, ~30-60s extra latency, one or two `code-reviewer` agent runs). Don't burn it on changes that don't warrant it. **If the task is trivial, abort and tell the user to just edit it normally.**

## The loop

1. **Coder pass.** Implement the task as you normally would. Use TaskCreate to track multi-step work. Do NOT commit yet.

2. **Round 1 review.** Spawn the `code-reviewer` agent with the prompt:
   > "Review the working diff against this project's documented conventions. The task being implemented is: `$ARGUMENTS`. Output the strict format from your spec."

   The reviewer reads `git diff`, cross-references project rules, and outputs:
   - `Status: CLEAN` → go to step 5.
   - `Status: NEEDS_CHANGES` with a numbered list of concrete file:line changes → go to step 3.

3. **Apply fixes.** Read the reviewer's findings. For each Critical / Improvement item:
   - If the finding is correct, apply the suggested change.
   - If the finding is wrong (the reviewer misread, missed context, or cited a rule that doesn't apply here), state explicitly *why* you're not applying it. Do NOT silently skip — the user needs to see the disagreement.
   - If the finding is borderline, apply it; the reviewer is configured to be willing to retract on the next round, so over-applying is safe.

4. **Round 2 review.** Spawn `code-reviewer` again with the same prompt. Three branches:
   - `Status: CLEAN` → go to step 5.
   - `Status: NEEDS_CHANGES` again → **stop the loop**. Surface the remaining findings to the user along with what you tried in Round 1. Do not auto-cycle to Round 3 — at this point either the reviewer is being pedantic, the coder is missing something, or the change needs more thought than a tight loop can give. The user decides.
   - Reviewer retracts Round 1 findings → also `CLEAN`; go to step 5.

5. **Ready-to-commit handoff.** Tell the user:
   - What was changed (one-line summary, not a recap of the diff).
   - Which review round produced the clean status.
   - Any Notes or Out-of-scope observations the reviewer surfaced (worth knowing, not blocking).
   - Ask whether to commit. **Never commit without being asked** (project rule from the root `CLAUDE.md`).

6. **On user "yes":** stage the changed files explicitly (don't `git add -A` — could pick up an unrelated SOPS plaintext sibling), draft a commit message that follows the project's style (no `Co-Authored-By`, no Claude footer, conventional-commit prefix per the recent log), commit, report success.

## Loop-termination guarantees

- Hard cap: 2 review cycles. Round 3 is forbidden.
- The reviewer cannot trigger a re-cycle with abstract concerns alone — its spec requires concrete numbered file:line diff changes for `NEEDS_CHANGES`. If it tries to cycle on vague "consider X" findings, treat as `CLEAN` and surface the comments to the user.
- The reviewer's `Out-of-scope observations` are informational only and never trigger a cycle, no matter how many.
- If the coder disagrees with a Round 1 finding and doesn't apply it, that disagreement must be visible in the Round 2 prompt context — quote the disagreement so the reviewer can re-evaluate.

## What this command does NOT replace

- `/check` is the lighter pre-commit gate — review + test-gap + doc-hygiene, single pass, advisory. Use it for everyday changes that don't warrant `/safe-edit`'s 2-3x cost. The two are complementary.
- `pnpm check` / `pnpm test` still run when you'd normally run them. The reviewer is on top of them, not instead.
- `/audit/*` is still the right tool for periodic broad sweeps. `/safe-edit` is per-change.

## Tone

Don't narrate the loop step-by-step in user-facing text. The user sees:
- Your normal coder updates (one sentence per significant step).
- A short "Round 1 review found N findings: [list]; applied them" or "Round 1 review came back clean."
- A short "Round 2 review came back clean — ready to commit. Want me to?" handoff.
- Or, if the loop terminates without consensus: a clear summary of what's still contested and a request for the user's call.
