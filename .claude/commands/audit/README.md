# Audit commands

Project-curated slash commands for running security, dependency, infra, and cost-control audits across the repo. Each is read-only by default — they report findings, they don't apply fixes without explicit confirmation.

Invoke from a Claude Code session as `/audit/<name>`.

## Index

### Security

| Command | What it checks |
|---|---|
| [/audit/secrets](secrets.md) | SOPS encryption status, plaintext-in-git history, server-only env in client paths, GitHub Actions secret hygiene |
| [/audit/xss](xss.md) | Svelte `{@html}`, portable-text rendering, dynamic href/src, server-rendered email HTML |

### Health

| Command | What it checks |
|---|---|
| [/audit/deps](deps.md) | `pnpm audit` per workspace, Dependabot coverage, GitHub Actions pin status, pnpm override hygiene |
| [/audit/infra](infra.md) | Terraform under `infra/` via `infra-auditor` — IAM least privilege, network exposure, data protection and recovery, alarm coverage |
| [/audit/cost-controls](cost-controls.md) | No runaway bill, via `infra-auditor`: Lambda worst-case ceilings, queue/job loops, retry storms, fan-out caps, growth, budget + alarms |

### Dispatcher

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| [/audit/all](all.md) | Spawns the full sweep in parallel + consolidated report. Optional arg: `security` / `deps` / `infra` / `cost`. |

## Conventions

- Every audit is **read-only by default**. The deliverable is a findings report, not a diff.
- Findings are grouped by severity: **Critical / High / Medium / Low**.
- Each command is a **self-contained prompt** — runnable from a fresh session with no prior context.
- Cross-references: findings tie back to `docs/security.md § Risk <n>` whenever they map to the documented risk register, and to the per-workspace `CLAUDE.md` rules they violate.

## Agent delegation

- **Security** commands (`secrets`, `xss`, `auth`) delegate to `repo-security-auditor`, which knows this app's trust boundaries (CloudFront shared secret + WAF, tokens, RLS via `withUser`, fetcher SSRF, renderer, SQS message trust, OIDC, the public repo).
- **`infra`** and **`cost-controls`** delegate to `infra-auditor`, which knows the Terraform, the Lambdas and queues, and the expected cost in `docs/deployment-tiers.md`.
- **`deps`** uses a `general-purpose` agent with the command body as the prompt.

`/audit/all` spawns one agent per area in parallel.

## Diff-time enforcement (complementary)

For per-PR enforcement (as opposed to periodic broad sweeps), use:

- [/check](../check.md) — pre-commit gate: `code-reviewer` + `test-gap-checker` + `doc-hygiene-checker` in parallel against the working diff.
- [/safe-edit](../safe-edit.md) — coder ↔ reviewer loop for non-trivial changes (~2-3x cost; use for security-sensitive or order-flow changes).
- [/release-readiness](../release-readiness.md) — pre-tag gate before publishing a release (working tree, CI, per-workspace deltas, open audit signals).

These are for per-PR / pre-deploy enforcement; the audit commands here are for periodic broad sweeps.

## When to run

- **Before a release** — `/audit/all` once, fix Critical / High before tagging. Then `/release-readiness`.
- **After bumping a dependency major** — `/audit/deps` + `/audit/secrets`.
- **After editing anything under `infra/`** — `/audit/infra` before `terraform apply`.
- **After adding a new backend route or email path** — `/audit/secrets` (catches new env-var leaks) + `/audit/xss` (catches new HTML email surfaces).
- **Periodically (monthly)** — `/audit/all` to catch slow-moving drift. The scheduled `audit.yml` workflow covers `pnpm audit` weekly; `/audit/all` adds the other audits to the picture.

## What's intentionally not here

Stack-specific audits (Postgres RLS, Edge Function JWTs, mobile-twin parity, paywall gates, privacy-zone clipping, schema-codegen drift, metadata-key registries, architecture-guard tests, etc.) are deliberately omitted from this base set. Add them as your project grows in that direction — start by writing the checklist as `.claude/commands/audit/<area>.md` and delegate to `repo-security-auditor` (for security surfaces) or `compliance-auditor` (for privacy / legal surfaces).
