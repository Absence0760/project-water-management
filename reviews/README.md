# reviews/

Output folder for the persona auditors (`.claude/agents/persona-*.md`). Each
persona writes its findings to `reviews/<persona-name>.md`.

**Everything in here except this README is git-ignored.** The reports are
per-clone working notes, not a committed artifact — they go stale the moment
code lands, so they're regenerated, not version-controlled.

## If you open a report to act on it

These are **living documents**. A finding is only as good as the commit it was
verified against (see the header stamp in each file). Before you act on, cite,
or hand off any finding:

1. Open the `file:line` it points at and confirm it still reproduces at HEAD.
2. If it's already fixed, move it to `## Resolved` with the fixing commit.
3. If you changed code that a report covers, re-run that persona so the report
   reconciles instead of drifting.

The full protocol — file format, severity rubric, the reconcile-before-you-trust
rule, and how to add project-specific domain personas — lives in
`.claude/personas/README.md`. Read it before editing a report by hand.

## Running the personas

Ask for one by name (`run persona-admin`), several at once, or the whole panel
via the `/persona` command. The generic panel that ships in every project:
`persona-new-user`, `persona-power-user`, `persona-admin`,
`persona-international-user`, `persona-accessibility-user`, `persona-integrator`,
`persona-adversary`, `persona-data-subject`. Projects add their own domain
personas alongside these.
