# HTTP API

Backend: Hono (`backend/src/app.ts`), dev on `http://localhost:3001`, prod behind
CloudFront at `/api`. All bodies are JSON. Shared TypeScript shapes live in
`packages/engine/src/project.ts` — both the backend and the frontend import them.

## Auth

Session = an HS256 JWT in an **httpOnly cookie** `wm_session` (`SameSite=Lax`,
`Secure` in prod, 7-day expiry). The browser sends it with `credentials: 'include'`;
CORS allows the frontend origin with credentials. There is no token in JS-readable
storage.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/register` | `{ email, password, displayName, inviteToken? }` | `201 { user }` + cookie; sends a verification email |
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{ email, password }` | `200 { user }` + cookie |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | – | `204`, clears cookie |
| GET | `/auth/me` | – | `200 { user }` or `401` |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | `{ email }` | **always** `202 { ok: true }` (public) |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | `{ token, password }` | `204`, clears cookie; `400` bad/expired/used link (public) |
| POST | `/auth/verify-email` | `{ token }` | `200 { verified: true }`; `400` bad/expired/used link (public) |
| POST | `/auth/resend-verification` | – | `202 { sent: true }`; `409` already verified; `429` sent < 1 min ago (signed in) |
| POST | `/auth/invite-info` | `{ token }` | `200 { invite: { email, projectName, teamName, invitedBy } }`; `404` bad/expired (public) |

`user = { id, email, displayName, emailVerified }`. Passwords: 8–200 chars.

**Email links.** Tokens are 32 random bytes (43 base64url chars), single-use,
stored only as SHA-256 hashes. Links point at `SITE_URL`:

| Email | Link | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confirm your email | `/verify-email?token=…` | 48 h |
| Reset your password | `/reset-password?token=…` | 1 h |
| Invitation | `/register?invite=…` | 7 days |

- **Sign-up** sends a verification email. Signing in doesn't require a
  verified address; the UI shows a banner until it is.
- **`forgot-password`** answers the same `202` whether or not the address has
  an account, and sends at most one email per address per minute (later
  requests inside the window get `202` and no email). Requesting again replaces
  the previous link.
- **`reset-password`** sets the new password, also marks the address verified
  (the link proved the inbox), and **signs out every existing session**
  (`app_user.sessions_revoked_at`; any session issued before it gets `401`).
  Sign in again afterwards.
- **`verify-email`** marks the address verified and turns every pending invite
  for it into a membership.
- **`register` with `inviteToken`** (from `/register?invite=…`): if the token is
  a live invite for *the same address*, the account starts verified and joins
  the invited projects/teams immediately, with no verification email.
  Otherwise the token is ignored and sign-up proceeds normally.

## Errors

Non-2xx responses are `{ error: string, details?: unknown }`. `401` = not signed
in; `404` = not found **or** not a member (RLS hides the project — the API never
reveals that a project exists); `403` = member without the needed role; `400` =
validation (`details` = zod issues); `409` = conflict (duplicate name, last owner);
`429` = an email was sent to this address moments ago.

## Projects

Roles: `viewer` (read) < `editor` (change model data, run the model) < `owner`
(members, delete, move between teams).

Your effective role is the highest of your direct membership and your team
membership: on a team's projects, a team **admin** is an `owner` and a team
**member** is an `editor`. Direct sharing (`/projects/:id/members`) still works
alongside teams, e.g. to give an outside client `viewer` access.

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects` | – | `{ projects: ProjectSummary[] }` | – |
| POST | `/projects` | `{ name, description?, teamId? }` | `201 { project }` (`teamId` must be a team you're in; omit/`null` = personal) | – |
| GET | `/projects/:id` | – | `{ project }` | viewer |
| PATCH | `/projects/:id` | `{ name?, description?, settings?, teamId? }` | `{ project }` | editor (owner when `teamId` is sent) |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id` | – | `204` | owner |
| POST | `/projects/:id/copy` | `{ name }` | `201 { project }` (model + series copied; runs not; stays in the team only if you're in it) | viewer |

- `ProjectSummary = { id, name, description, role, team, createdAt, updatedAt }`
- `team = { id, name } | null` — `null` for a personal project. `name` is
  `null` when you reach a team's project through direct sharing but aren't in
  the team (team names are visible to members only).
- `PATCH { teamId }` moves the project into a team you belong to (`404 team not
  found` otherwise) or, with `null`, back to personal. Owner only.
- `project = ProjectSummary & { settings: ProjectSettings }` — settings are
  returned merged over the defaults, so the client always sees every field.

### Members

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/:id/members` | – | `{ members: { userId, email, displayName, role }[] }` | viewer |
| POST | `/projects/:id/members` | `{ email, role }` | `201 { member }` for an existing account; `201 { invited: true, invite }` when no account has the address (see Invites) | owner |
| PATCH | `/projects/:id/members/:userId` | `{ role }` | `{ member }` | owner |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id/members/:userId` | – | `204` (owners remove anyone; anyone may remove themselves) | – |

These are **direct** members only. People who reach a team project through the
team are listed by `GET /teams/:id`, not here.

### Invites

Adding an address that has no account creates a **pending invite** and emails
it a sign-up link (`/register?invite=…`, valid 7 days). The invite becomes a
membership with the invited role once that address is **verified** — by
signing up through the link, or by signing up normally and clicking the
verification email. An unverified sign-up alone does not claim invites.
Re-adding the same address updates the role; the email is re-sent (with a
fresh link, the old one stops working) unless one went out in the last minute.
Adding an address after it has registered makes it a member directly and
clears its invite.

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/:id/invites` | – | `{ invites: Invite[] }` (newest first, expired ones included) | owner |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id/invites/:inviteId` | – | `204` (revoke; the link stops working) | owner |

- `Invite = { id, email, role, invitedBy, createdAt, expiresAt, expired }` —
  `invitedBy` is the display name of whoever last sent it.

## Teams

A team owns many projects (catchments) together. Team roles: `member` <
`admin`. Admins rename/delete the team and manage its members; on the team's
projects admins are owners and members are editors (see Projects above).

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min team role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/teams` | – | `{ teams: Team[] }` (teams you're in, by name) | – |
| POST | `/teams` | `{ name }` | `201 { team }` (you become its admin) | – |
| GET | `/teams/:id` | – | `{ team, members: TeamMember[] }` (admins first) | member |
| PATCH | `/teams/:id` | `{ name }` | `{ team }` | admin |
| DELETE | `/teams/:id` | – | `204` — its projects stay, owned by their direct members (`team` → `null`) | admin |
| POST | `/teams/:id/members` | `{ email, role }` | `201 { member }`, or `201 { invited: true, invite }` when no account has that email (see Projects § Invites); `409` if already a member | admin |
| PATCH | `/teams/:id/members/:userId` | `{ role }` | `{ member }` | admin |
| DELETE | `/teams/:id/members/:userId` | – | `204` (admins remove anyone; anyone may remove themselves = leave) | member |
| GET | `/teams/:id/invites` | – | `{ invites: Invite[] }` | admin |
| DELETE | `/teams/:id/invites/:inviteId` | – | `204` | admin |

- `Team = { id, name, role, createdAt, memberCount, projectCount }` — `role` is
  **your** role in the team.
- `TeamMember = { userId, email, displayName, role }`
- `409 a team must keep at least one admin` when removing or demoting the last
  admin (including the last admin leaving). A team you aren't in is `404`.

## Model data

The editable model (network, crops, crop areas, transfers) is read and saved as
one document — the editor holds it in memory and saves it in one transaction.
Ids are client-generated UUIDs; rows missing from a `PUT` are deleted.

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/:id/model` | – | `ProjectModel` | viewer |
| PUT | `/projects/:id/model` | `ProjectModel` | `ProjectModel` | editor |

Validation on `PUT`: node names unique; every `downstreamNodeId`, crop-area and
transfer reference points at a node/crop in the same document; the network is a
tree (no cycles) with exactly one node whose `downstreamNodeId` is `null`
(the outflow gauge) — unless the model is empty.

## Time series

Daily series, `values[i]` = value on `startDate + i` days, `null` = missing.

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/projects/:id/series` | – | `{ series: SeriesMeta[] }` | viewer |
| GET | `/projects/:id/series/:seriesId` | – | `SeriesMeta & { values }` | viewer |
| PUT | `/projects/:id/series` | `{ kind, name?, unit, startDate, values }` | `SeriesMeta` (upsert on kind+name) | editor |
| POST | `/projects/:id/series/merge` | `{ kind, name?, unit, startDate, values }` | `SeriesMeta` (merge by date; creates the series if missing) | editor |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id/series/:seriesId` | – | `204` | editor |

`merge` is for daily or batch appends (loggers, CHIRPS, forecasts): the days
sent are merged into the existing series by date. Incoming values win on
overlapping days, the series extends in either direction, and any gap days
between the old and new ranges become `null`. `413` if the merged series would
exceed 60 000 days.

`kind` ∈ `SERIES_KINDS` (`packages/engine/src/project.ts`). Max 60 000 values
(~164 years).

## Runs

Running the model is synchronous: the backend loads the project, calls the
engine's `runModel`, stores the outputs, and returns the summary.

| Method | Path | Body | Response | Min role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/projects/:id/runs` | `{ label? }` | `201 { run }` | editor |
| GET | `/projects/:id/runs` | – | `{ runs: RunMeta[] }` (newest first) | viewer |
| GET | `/projects/:id/runs/:runId` | – | `{ run, series: { nodeId, key, label, unit }[] }` | viewer |
| GET | `/projects/:id/runs/:runId/series?key=…&nodeId=…` | – | `{ startDate, values }` (omit `nodeId` for catchment series) | viewer |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id/runs/:runId` | – | `204` | editor |

- `RunMeta = { id, label, engineVersion, startDate, endDate, createdAt, createdBy }`
- `run = RunMeta & { summary: RunSummary }`

## Health

`GET /health` → `{ ok: true }`.
